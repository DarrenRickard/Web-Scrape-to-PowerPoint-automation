AAFES Furniture Book

CLI/GUI tool to scrape ShopMyExchange.com for item data by CRC# and automate PowerPoint slide creation.

Ideally, I want to send an HTTP Request to ShopMyExchange.com to search for the item by CRC#

Libraries to use:
	BeautifulSoup
	requests
	Pyautogui
	webbrowser (this library is based on opening an actual browser and is bot-ish)
	time (for sleep, avoid automation detection)

Issues:
	Find out how to go to website and make a search query in the search bar for the CRC#

~important html tags to scrape

<h1 class='aafes-page-head'>
	Copy inner text as Item Title and insert to PP slide

<img class='jsFeaturedImage' src='link to jpg image'> 
	Copy the src value as image and insert to PP slide

<span class='product-desc'>
	Copy inner text as product description and insert to PP slide

<li>
	Copy inner text as additional product description and insert to PP Slide

<tr>
	Create dict of all <tr> with their <th> & <td> 
	if "Consumer Item {height}" in <th> 
	extract <td>.innerText as "Consumer Item {height}: <td>.innerText
